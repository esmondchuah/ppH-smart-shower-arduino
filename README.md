# ppH Smart Shower - An Arduino System
#### MOTIVATION
Tackling water wastage during showers.


#### IMPLEMENTATION
Proximity and pH sensor shower system.

→ **Proximity**: Reduce to a trickling shower when user is not in the “shower zone”.

→ **pH**: Smart system to decide when the user should end a shower.


#### HOW DOES THE pH SENSOR WORK?
Track the duration of neutrality between peaks of alkalinity to predict the user’s shower cycle, and provide non-intrusive cues to the user to end the shower.
